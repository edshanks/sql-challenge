You can find the table schemata in the "schemata" SQL file and the queries can be found in the "queries" SQL file. The ERD is saved as a PNG file named "Pewlett Hackard ERD". All three of these files are located in the EmployeeSQL folder.

I used https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ to generate my ERD. I have included the QuickDBD code as a text file named "QuickDBD ERD script". This file can be found in the EmployeeSQL folder.

I had to copy and paste the schemata scripts directly from PGAdmin because I did not save them in an external text file when I initially created the tables. For this reason, some of the code looks a little different than the code I originally wrote. However I did my best to make the table schemata look like they did when I wrote them initially. 

While working on the seventh query, I had issues and asked the instructor for help. He suggested using constants for the department names in each query and then using a UNION statement to combine them. I used this idea in my solution.
